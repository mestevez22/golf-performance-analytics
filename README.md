# golf-performance-analytics
A comprehensive data analytics project focused on analyzing golf practice session data. This project includes Python scripts for data collection and cleaning, R scripts for statistical analysis (linear regression and random forest), and Tableau dashboards for visualizing insights to help golfers improve their performance.


#OVERVIEW
This repository contains code and data used to analyze golf performance metrics, focusing on carry distance, club speed, ball speed, and launch angles. The project uses Python for data collection and cleaning, R for statistical analysis, and Tableau for data visualization.

#REPOSITORY CONTENTS 

Code Files
1. Golf Stats_Prep_LinReg.ipynb (Python):
Jupyter Notebook for cleaning and merging golf practice session data into a master file. The notebook includes data wrangling steps using Pandas and NumPy.

2. Rapsodo_Login_download.ipynb (Python):
Jupyter Notebook for logging into the Rapsodo platform and downloading golf practice session data, automates same process.


3. Golf Stats Analysis_LinRef_RF.rmd (R):
